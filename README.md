Directions:

Run run_analysis.R

by
chmod +x run_analysis.R
./run_analysis

or source("run_analysis.R") in R shell.

The "UCI HAR Dataset/" must be in the same directory.

The script will read the contents of "UCI HAR Dataset/test" and "UCI HAR Dataset/train"
datasets, merge them, and produce an output table output.txt showing with average values
for all combinations of the Subject and Activity variables.  See CodeBook.md for more
information on the output table format.
